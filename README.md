About me:

I’m Mircea, an Automotive Engineer turned into Events Coordinator turned into Backpack Traveller. Between 2023 and 2024 I have traveled continuously for 9 months and now, upon my return home, I have decided that I desire a new professional challenge.

My professional background reveals my versatility and ease of adapting to different professional environments. I am an organized and attentive to detail person, but also a good communicator and a problem solver.

Recently I graduated a training in Python Programming and Automation Testing and I am continuously studying in order to master the professional challenge of Software Testing.
