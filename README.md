About me:

I’m Mircea, an Automotive Engineer turned into Events Coordinator turned into Backpack Traveller turned into Junior QA Automation Tester. Between 2023 and 2024 I have traveled continuously for 9 months and upon my return home I have decided that I desire a new professional challenge.

My professional background reveals my versatility and easiness of adapting to different professional environments. I am an organized and attentive to detail person, but also a good communicator and a problem solver. In addition to this I am confident in the help my education as an engineer will give me in mastering this new profession.

Recently I graduated a QA Automation Testing course with IT Factory and I am continuously studying in order to learn and overcome the professional challenges of Software Testing.
